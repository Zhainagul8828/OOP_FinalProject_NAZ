#About project
This project is a system that works like a receptionist at a hospital. Nowadays, we see a long queue for seeing a doctor. Sometimes just to get a consultation you must wait a long time. So, this software helps both doctors and patients to save time. 
Patients will register, then they can find a specific doctor to see then in “Your initial complains” will write her/his complaints, after submitting she/he will wait for the doctor’s report. Also, patients can choose “NO” in the section “Are you cured” to get a better or new consultation. 
The doctors also have to register. After getting a new patient-doctor should write his report, disease name, and medicine. In case if the patient is satisfied and gets cured doctor gets “Yes” in the section cured.
